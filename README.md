# Design Note

The design for this portfolio is inspired by an open source front-end portfolio by Sebastian Graf and can be found here <https://seb-graf.com/>. However, the build of the website including CSS, HTML, and JS is entirely my own.

Todo: Queries under 1100px, hovering or clicking a card causes the description card to minimize and shift upwards, and the project image card to expand. Effect is reveresed when element is out of focus, or when clicked back. Can be done using ::focus or adding JS classes. ::focus and ::hover is probably better for speed.
